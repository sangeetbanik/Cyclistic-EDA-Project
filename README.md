# Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study

## üìù Introduction 
The **Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study** is a capstone project for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** on Coursera. In this project, I will follow the data analysis process which I learned from the course: <ins>ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act</ins> to analyze the data. 

## üí¨ Background
Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago that launched its bike-sharing initiative in 2016. Since then, it has grown to include 5,824 bicycles and 692 geotracked stations distributed throughout the city. The system allows customers to rent bikes at one station and return them at any other, making it a convenient transportation option. This ease of use has helped Cyclistic's bike-sharing service become popular.

Cyclistic‚Äôs marketing efforts have mainly concentrated on raising general awareness and targeting a broad audience. The company offers flexible pricing models to accommodate different user needs, including single-ride tickets, day passes (collectively referred as <b>casual riders</b>), and yearly memberships(<b> referred as Cyclistic members</b>). Additionally, Cyclistic provides special bike options like reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making the service accessible to people with disabilities and those unable to use traditional two-wheeled bicycles. 

The marketing director believes the company's success will depend on increasing the number of annual memberships. As part of the junior data analysis team, my role is to study the differences between casual riders and annual members to develop a marketing strategy aimed at converting more casual riders into members.


## ‚öô Approach/Steps
### 1. Ask
**Business Task -** design marketing strategies to **convert casual riders to members** by understanding how annual and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.<br>

> Questions for guiding future marketing program: 
> 1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
> 2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
> 3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

#### Data Combining
The 12 tables from **January 2022 to December 2022** were stacked and combined into a single table. The table consists of 5,667,717 rows.

#### Data Exploration
I ran the queries for each column from left to right in order to determine the **data type** and to uncover any **missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and errors** within the dataset. 

The data set consists of **13 variables**, as shown in the following: <br>

| **No.**|  **Variable**       |  **Description**                                        |
|--------|------------------   | --------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | ride_id             | Unique ID assigned to each ride                         |
| 2      | rideable_type       | classic, docked, or electric                            |
| 3      | started_at          | Date and time at the start of trip                      |

| 8      | end_station_id      | ID of the station where the ride trip ended at          |
| 9      | start_lat           | Latitude of starting station                            |
| 10     | start_lng           | Longitude of starting station                           |
| 11     | end_lat             | Latitude of ending station                              |

#### Data Cleaning
Before analyzing the data, the dataset was cleaned by:
- Removing the trips with **null values**.
- Adding 3 columns: '**ride_length_in_mins**', '**day_of_week**' and '**month**'.
- Exclusing the **rides with duration less than a minute** or **longer than a day**.

In total, 4,224,062 rows were returned, which means **1,443,655 rows were removed**.

### 4. Analyze
#### Data Analysis
The analysis question is: 
> How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

The cleaned data is imported into Tableau for analysis and the figures plotted are displayed in the following.

View [Cyclistic Bike Share Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hui.min.ho/viz/CyclisticBikeShareCaseStudy_16931448059910/Sheet1#2).

The similiarities and differences between Cyclistic members and casual riders were drawn from the dashboard above.

**Similarities:**
- Both Cyclistic members and casual riders **prefer riding bicycles in the spring and summer seasons** (from May to September). However, the number of rides decrease since September. This may be due to change of season in which the weather temperature drops and becomes uncomfortable for rides. 
- Both Cyclistic members and casual riders **prefer classic bicycles over electric bicycles**. 
- Both Cyclistic members and casual riders have **higher average ride duration on weekends as compared to on weekdays**.

**Differences:**
- **Cyclistic members** go on **more rides** than casual riders.
- **Cyclistic members** have **smaller average ride length** (12.41 minutes) than casual riders (23.82 minutes). Hence, this may suggest that the Cyclistic members take the bicycles for **short trips or short distance travel**. 
- **Cyclistic members** show **consistent rides** throughout the week while casual riders have the busiest activites on weekends and lowest activities during weekdays. This may indicate that the Cyclistic members use the bicycles for ***purpose-oriented rides** such as work or errands while the casual riders use bicycles for leisure or recreational activities.  

### 6. Act
#### <ins>Recommendations</ins>
From the analysis above, we can design marketing strategies to convert casual riders to Cyclistic members. Here are my suggested approach:

- **Membership Personalisation** <br>
Provide a range of membership personalizations: yearly, monthly and daily. For example, $365/year, $45/month, $3/day. Users will be able to choose their membership type according to their own preferences. By introducing shorter-term membership plans with appropriate pricing, we can cater the needs of riders who might not need an annual membership.

- **Group Membership Discounts** <br>
Offerdiscounted plans for friends, students, and families can encourage collective memberships. Furthermore, it encourages users to cycle together and strengthen the bonds between people.

- **Membership Loyalty Points System** <br>
Implement a membership loyalty points system for users to collect points for each ride. Rewards such as membership discount will be given based on the number of points collected. This will encourage riders to use the service more frequently, driving engagement and loyalty. 

- **Member-Exclusive Events** <br>
Organize member-exclusive events such as group rides, urban exploration challenges, or themed cycling events. This approach not only encourages more rides from current members but also entices casual riders to join as members to participate in these unique experiences. 

- **Seasonal campaigns** <br>
Launch seasonal campaigns by offering limited-time discounts, special weekdays offers, or extended ride durations for members during these seasons to help in making the service more sustainable and manageable.

- **Social Media Engagement** <br>
Utilize digital media, including social media platforms, to engage with both casual riders and potential members. Share success stories, testimonials, and user-generated content from Cyclistic members who have benefited from the membership. Create visually appealing content showcasing the joy of cycling during different seasons and scenarios, enticing casual riders to become members. 


## üîÆ Conclusion
In short, this analysis provides valuable insights into the preferences and behaviors of Cyclistic members and casual riders. By tailoring strategies to the identified differences and preferences, Cyclistic can effectively convert casual riders into portential members.
